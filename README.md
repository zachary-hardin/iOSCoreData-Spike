## Notes:
* An entity is a class definition in Core Data. The classic example is an Employee or a Company. In a relational database, an entity corresponds to a table.
* An attribute is a piece of information attached to a particular entity. For example, an Employee entity could have attributes for the employeeâ€™s name, position and salary. In a database, an attribute corresponds to a particular field in a table.
* A relationship is a link between multiple entities. In Core Data, relationships between two entities are called to-one relationships, while those between one and many entities are called to-many relationships. For example, a Manager can have a to-many relationship with a set of employees, whereas an individual Employee will usually have a to-one relationship with his manager.
